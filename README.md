## Run Locally - Initial Start

After cloning your project down to your Documents folder, open the project folder for editing in VS Code.

Create a local project virtual environment named .venv, activate it, and install the requirements.

When VS Code asks to use it for the workspace, select Yes.
If you miss the window, after installing, select from the VS Code menu, View / Command Palette, and type "Python: Select Interpreter" and select the .venv folder.

Open a terminal (VS Code menu "View" / "Terminal") in the root project folder and run these commands (for Windows - the activate command is slightly different Linux/Mac).

```shell
py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate
py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```
